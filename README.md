# Portfolio

My portfolio app built on the JAMstack (JavaScript, APIs, and Markup).

https://blif.io

## Overview

My portfolio was designed not only to feature my work and provide information about myself, but also as a test bed or scaffolding for technologies and work flows I plan to implement in future projects, both personally and professionally.

## Technical

This lightweight site is engineered using the JAMstack, relying on React, Redux, and Contentful to produce a fast, "serverless", highly-performant application that is secure, easy to update, and easy to deploy. To combat long loading times, React-Snapshot is integrated into the build process to produce static HTML markup of all pages, which dramatically decreases the perceived loading speed of the app, especially on slower internet connections.

* React is responsible for the front-end, with content being provided through APIs.
* Contentful, an API-first, headless CMS delivers all content, including markdown, as JSON through their API over a CDN. Content is managed through their cloud-hosted CMS. Images are also provided over Contentful's CDN.
* Redux handles all global state management. Redux-Thunk and Redux-Promise middleware included to provide more functionality to action creators.
* React Router handles routing on the client-side.
* React-Snapshot is added as a final step in the build process to produce static HTML for all relative paths greatly increasing perceived loading performance.
* Styling is provided by Styled Components, with structural elements provided by React Bootstrap.

## Deployment

This app is currently being served by an Nginx webserver hosted on a Linode VPS running Ubuntu 16.04.

## Development Roadmap

This is v1.0 of the app, but future enhancements are expected to include:
* Move app from its current VPS to a static server with a global CDN, like those provided by Netlify or Surge.
* Introduce a more comprehensive test suite.
* Integrate continuous deployment.
* Provide a Case Studies section for the most interesting projects and client apps, with each getting its own page.
* Provide a Recent Works page to showcase recent client apps.
